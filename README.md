*Intentions*
	This command helps new members or former members of a team to present themselves to others.

	I designed this command because in my team i seen that there were to much recurrence. It means that when a new user

	was comming, we all rushed to ask him his, name,his jobs, which techs does he use.... Only think if the team has more than tenor hundred members ? This will become too hard.

*Usage*
	The usage of the command is very straightfoward.
	The user just has to type 

	```/iam create [presentation_text] ``` to present himself to others.
	Or maybe there was an mistake during creating the presentation? Don't be worried just use
	```/iam edit [new_introduction]```` and when you have finished type the button ```Enter``` on your keyboard.
	In order to view the presentation of a specific user you just have to type ```/iam show [user] ``.
