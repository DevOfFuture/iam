*Intentions*
------------
This command helps new members or former members of a slack team to present themselves to others. I designed this command because in my team i seen that there were to much recurrence. It means that when a new user was comming, we all rushed to ask him his, name,his jobs, which techs does he use.... Only think if the team has more than ten or hundred  members ? This will become too hard to know who is who! So i create this command to remedy this problem.

*Usage*
------
The usage of the command is very straightfoward.

The user just has to type  ``/iam create [presentation_text]`` to present himself to others.

Or maybe there was an mistake during creating the presentation ? Don't be worried just use

``/iam edit [new_introduction]`` and when you have finished type the button ```Enter``` on your keyboard.

In order to view the presentation of a specific user you just have to type ```/iam show [user] ``.

For viewing this guide the user should only type ``/iam`` without any options.
